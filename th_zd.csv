Hey Radhi, thanks for getting in touch! I'm happy to help here - 
 
I do see that you had cancelled your Straight Up Strength subscription. No worries - I have re-activated your subscription, and adjusted your billing to the annual plan, including the Black Friday discount. 
 
Since you were recently billed for the monthly option, we will only bill you the difference between what you've already paid and the annual amount. $216 will bill tomorrow for the yearly subscription. After that, your subscription will be set to renew on 11/18/2023 for $270.
 
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions. We're happy to offer a spot!
 
Stay Strong,

TH Marketplace Payout July 2024,"Hey support team, this doesn't match our July take-home numbers in the report. If you dig into the report, it totals $3661.48 for take home amount, I'm not sure why the summary shows $3655.53.

I double-checked it twice to confirm, as I was closing the books for the end of the month!

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. I signed up for a 7-day free trial of your app and recently was charged for the first month. I tried to cancel my subscription earlier today through the app, but I was having some kind of issue with my app (or my phone) and it did not actually cancel the subscription. 

By the time I got home, I saw that I've been charged for the first month. I've just cancelled on my computer, but I'm emailing to ask if it's possible to get a refund for this first month. To be clear, I had no problem with the app experience - I just can't really do a lot of the program I got the trial for, because the gym I have access to right now has very limited equipment. 

Especially given that I did try cancelling it earlier today, if there's any flexibility in getting that first month refunded, that would be much appreciated.

All the best,
Niall"

Mistake,"Hi Nathan

It seems to be the same problem with the conversions again.

I have 2 athletes starting and I can see that it says TrainHeroic source and therefore taxed my membership to the max.
But Mette Schacht Pedersen & Diana Ghermatsion are people that I know personally and they did their membership through my link on Instagram. 
Can you please change them from trainheroic source to Instagram so I can get less taxed. 


I don't know why this happens but it happened with many others of my athletes. Josh had to change them manually. He did look into my links and  they all seemed normal. I don't know why it happens :/

I have a longer question so I'm going to try to ma...,"I have a longer question so I'm going to try to make this as short as possible.

I run Melt Programming. Basically, I offer 4 programs to my subscribers. They are the MetCon Program, Full Body Strength Program, Push/Pull/Leg Day Program, and Minimal Equipment Program.

Unfortunately, I didn't really know what I was doing when I started out and I made all these programs under one program in Train Heroic. So when someone signs up for my program, they have access to all 4 of these programs. All of these programs are under the same ""Team"" in Train Heroic, so when someone logs into the app, they have all of these programs listed down a line.

I get questions all the time from members on which program to follow and are they supposed to do everything listed in the given day because they are all under one ""Team"". If I could start over, I would create 4 different programs for people to sign up for and separate them out, rather than having them under one big umbrella.

Does this make sense? Is there anyway to separate out my 4 programs, without having people to cancel and re-sign up? For example, if someone wants to do the MetCon program for the day, I want them to be able to just select the MetCon program, instead of having to scroll down and find it. People get confused becuase theres so much listed in one day and they think they have to do all of it, when there are 4 different programs in there.

I'll attach a screen shot of what I mean. Youll see in the picture that all my programs are listed in the same team, leading to a lot of content and confusion.

Please let me know if theres anything I can do to fix this or if you have any idea on how to filter it so if someone wants to follow the Minimal Equipment Program, then it is just listed for them in the app, instead of having to scroll down and find the mininal equipment workout of the day.

I hope this all made sense. Please let me know of any questions.
Thanks!

Emily - Thank you! I genuinely appreciate the swift reply and insight. I’ll definitely leave a review. In lieu of buying both programs is it possible to switch from HAMR to Bedrock for a period of time? If it’s better to just reach out to customer service to facilitate? Thanks again! I’m looking forward to starting the coaching course and hope you have a great weekend.

Hey James,

First off, thanks for the love, and I’m glad our podcast has you laughing—even if it’s mid-lift! Nothing like a little humor to go with heavy barbells, but hey, at least we're keeping you on your toes.

It’s awesome to hear you’ve been crushing HAMR and that it’s hitting that sweet spot between your CrossFit background and years of strength training. If you haven’t had the chance yet, we’d love for you to leave us a review on Trustpilot and share your experience 👉 https://www.trustpilot.com/review/powerathletehq.com.

You clearly have a strong foundation, which makes us even more excited about your interest in the Power Athlete Certified Coaching path. We’d be thrilled to have you join the ranks of coaches making a difference, especially in your local schools where it sounds like those kids could really benefit from proper programming.

Now, for your son—sounds like he’s already following in your footsteps. For a 12-year-old multi-sport athlete, our Bedrock👈 (https://powerathletehq.com/bedrock/) program would be the best place to start. It’s specifically designed to build that solid athletic foundation while keeping it safe and scalable. Starting there ensures he’s set up for long-term success as he grows and develops. HAMR might be a bit intense for him at this stage, but Bedrock will provide exactly what he needs to progress steadily without pushing him too hard too soon.

Don't hesitate to reach out with any other questions you’ve got along the way.

Here's what James Anderson had to say:

Team - Good afternoon. First off I've been listening to the Podcast for awhile now and love it. The only negative is that sometimes I listen while working out.... John or his guest say something funny as hell while I'm under the barbell and I damn near drop it laughing.

Anyway, as a result of listening I started HAMR a few months back and have really enjoyed. I've done Crossfit for a number of years and before that I've spent years strength training through high school and college athletics. HAMR has done a great job giving me a little of all of that.

Subsequently, I've always been interested in learning more about S&C coaching in order to volunteer and help in our local schools since there is no S&C programming unfortunately. With the said I'm currently looking at the Certified Power Athlete Coach certification.

Finally for the program question... My son is 12 almost 13 and is active in a number of sports and just played his first season of tackle football. He's active and we're looking to get him into a workout program a couple days a week. So far I've only had him doing some body weight (push ups, air squats and burpess/ring pulls) and occasionally empty bar bench, squat & DL. I was wondering if something like Field Strong a couple days a week or maybe have him just join me on HAMR would be recommended? I appreciate your patience during my long winded question and for any feedback. Thanks and have a great day.

Warm regards,
James A.

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Good Morning,

I had originally signed up for a free trial of a plan to see what it would look like. If you check, I was never able to workout with the plan because I have been horribly sick all week. When I noticed I still had the free trial, I tried cancelling it and couldn’t find a single way how. I checked Apple subscriptions and it wasn’t there, so I figured that the free trial auto cancels. I took a brief look at the TrainHeroic app, but there was no good indication of where I could cancel my subscription. Because of that, I thought that my subscription was cancelled. I got charged this morning for a subscription I didn’t even know I had. If you guys are unable to issue a refund, then you need to make it more clear on your app in the future where to cancel a subscription.


Thanks,
Nate"

Please can this be rectified I do not want to continue the subscription after the 7 day trial but I am still on the system as a member with the app even though I am not and I do not wish to be.

Access Code,"Good afternoon,

Several days ago I downloaded the app and purchased the yearly subscription. I did this because I will be training a client who previously and currently uses the app (his old coach left).

I have the app, paid but I do not have an access code to connect with the client. I then noticed there is a coaches account with another membership needed. So I am a bit confused. I'm happy to pay for what is needed but feel like I am paying for 2 accounts (app + coaching?)

I have reviewed FAQ and it still is not giving me what I am looking for. I believe at this point I have 2 accounts with 2 different emails.

I appreciate any help you can give. To clarify what I am needing.

I want to use the app to send programs to my clients. I will not be using it for my own training, only to connect with clients and send them their customized workouts.

She tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and that didn't work. Not sure where to go from here.

Mobile Feedback,"Feedback: The app deletes most of my sessions after I’ve done them. It will usually hold them for the current week, but as soon as I navigate to a different week, sessions get deleted and they can’t be retrieved. The more I navigate, the more sessions get deleted. Recording the sessions is pointless if the data is just going to be deleted every time. The problem seems to have gotten worse the longer I have used the app. I want to be able to look at my results long term, but I’m afraid to navigate away from the current screen, as I know data will be lost. This also means that when I look at the progress of an exercise over time, I am seeing incomplete information.

I'm writing on behalf of Daniele; I'll help him set up the marketplace on TH.

We enabled the marketplace last Thursday, but some features are still unclear.

Our primary audience is currently in the EU. Can we set the price in EUR? I see only USD as a current option.

How often will the payout be sent to Paypal, and what percentage will TH keep for the transactions?

Daniele would like to sell a monthly subscription. Do you confirm that we should manage the 'teams' section?

He signed up for a the “Newcastle Weightlifting Club (online)” teams program on 2024-09-08. On my side it says status cancelled. So either he cancelled or maybe an issue with the conversion, maybe bank detail issue? He messaged be today stating that his session are not there but he didn't cancel.

<p dir=""auto"">And now, a follow-up to the previous situation.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">We are wanting to convert my personal assistant coach account into a general gym coaching account, that not just myself but our small team of coaches could all access and utilize the same way I have been. For example, my ""Ian Cutting' would become ""CA Coaching Team"", or something like that, TDB. Ultimately it would also have its own unique email address attached to it too, but that is a secondary step for now.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Doing this would keep all of the created programs under the same login, and keep staff out of the gym owner's head coaching account.</p>

Here's what Jamison Williams had to say:

Greetings!

I currently follow Field Strong and I absolutely love it!

Unfortunately, due to time commitments with work and other things going on with my personal life, I need more flexibility. I was thinking of switching to Grindstone for a few months. How would I go about doing that?

I am reaching out because I am currently in the process of potentially joining the National Guard on an 18x contract for the reserve component of the Special Forces.

TrainHeroic - Updating Your Billing Info,"Hello, 

1. I was going to purchase a 6 week program and usually the card I have on file pops up when I want to check out after signing in. Now, it’s saying to input the card info again. What happened to the auto populating card info feature? 

2. I accidentally unsubscribed to a program I like and want to keep it. Do I have to wait until it expires then resign back up or can you reactivate it on y’all’s end? 

Thank you!"

<p dir=""auto"">I apologize for so many emails. I am trying to set up Zapier that you told me about. </p>

<p dir=""auto"">I wanted to give it a full try and see what it would look like on both ends when someone canceled. I subscribed to my program on TrainHeroic and when I went to delete/cancel the subscription from my phone, it flags it and says ""if you own the team, please use Coach on the web."" I tried to use the Coach on the web but it still will not let me remove myself from the subscription. I was hoping you could help walk me through it.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Also when someone purchases one of my training subscriptions are they added and counted as one of my active athletes on my coaching plan? I have 22 athletes but only 7 1:1 training athletes the rest are subscription. I ask this because my coaching plan says I am on the up to 25 athletes and want to know if I will be upgraded if I add 3 subscription clients. </p>

Question about Athlete Pro Subscription,"Dear Trainheroic Customer Support Team,

I currently have an active Trainheroic Athlete Pro Subscription on my iphone. I am also subscribed to a training program, namely to a training program called ""Operation: Human Weapon"" for which I am roughly paying 15 USD per month.

My question is the following: If I cancel the Athlete Pro Subscription and remain subscribed to the monthly training program what would that change? Would I still have full access to the training program? And what is the advantage then of paying the Athlete Pro subscription?

I would really appreciate a clarification on this one.

Thank you so much in advance.

Best,

Sebastian"

Re: Monthly Billing Receipt from TrainHeroic,"Hi there,

I’d forgotten to cancel this. I was using it to create workouts for my dad, but he stopped training due to illness. As you’ll be able to see, I haven’t used it in a while. I’d really appreciate it if you could refund me for three months worth of dues.

Thanks very much,

Lift Heavy, Swing Fast New Cycle Workout 1 - Live on September 30th

This workout consists of supersets. Complete each exercise in the order listed before starting over again from the first.

For example, perform A1 and A2 once in order, then return to A1 and repeat for the prescribed sets.

All movements have video demonstrations with audio instructions linked to our YouTube channel. (https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0xe4704tvh8l0gwrc6h6g0e5ggul/owhkhqhrm685lluv/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vQENvZHlXZXNjb3R0R29sZg==) ​

Before starting, warm up with 3-5 minutes of light cardio - such as jogging, walking or any machine at a low to moderate pace.

Once you finish this workout, you’ll have a great feel for what this program is all about.

Nothing showing,"Good morning 

Set the free trial up last Sunday and have done six days of training on the GBRS program. Now on the seventh day of the free trial my calendar shows no training plan for this last day of the trial. No explanation of this is a rest day etc. I have been billed for an upcoming month and yet I see no training plans for this upcoming week? I tried refreshing and also logging out and back in. What is the next step? My only training time is early morning and so now I am doing my own workout today because nothing is scheduled.

TrainHeroic - Updating Your Billing Info,"Hello,

 

Hope you are well.

➡️ Brand new GARAGE GANGSTERS training cycle starts TODAY!

I’ll show you how to make insane progress at HOME in minimal time!

New Meso Cycle Info:
👊 4 days/week
👊 45-60min sessions
👊 Basic garage gym equipment
👊 Upper/Lower rotational split
👊 Expert coaching
👊 Committed teammates

Basic equipment you need:
✔️ Barbell & plates
✔️ A few bands
✔️ Squat rack
✔️ Some dip and chin stations
✔️ A trap/hex bar
✔️ And dumbbells that can challenge you

I also make sure that the movement sequence of the workout is such that moving from one exercise to the other is quite seamless, saving you a bunch of unnecessary setup time so you can just focus on having the most productive session possible!

This program has people hitting weights and seeing gains they never thought were possible, especially with a pretty minimal home gym setup!

"Hi there,

When I generate supersets or circuits with multiple exercises - all the tutorial videos become the same.

So let's say there are three exercise in a circuit.

A1
A2
A3

A2 and A3 will have the same tutorial video as A1, even though A2 and A3 have their own independent tutorial video normally.

Please can you help me with this as it's becoming quite a problem with my clients.

Kind regards

This was fixed and I think they said it was a glitch. This has happened again to the second returning member. It seems to be every time I unarchive and readd them to the team (or a coincidence?). Am i doing this wrong, is there a better way to unarchive and readd them? Obviously i want to archive them because they may come back but i don't want to be paying keeping them active.

Thanks

2. Choose 'Billing Info'
3. Select 'Cancel Plan' and confirm by choosing 'Yes, Cancel My Plan'


My log in email address is hqcsocial@gmail.com but I cannot remember the password to his old email address hence why I am sending an email from my blackdam barbell email address.

Questions about pricing,"Hey guys,

I'm trying to compare prices and take home pay between TrainHeroic and Playbook. So far this is what Playbook said: “As a creator on our platform, you'll take home 77% to 78% of the profits from your subscriptions. We collect 20% of your earnings, and Apple or Google take 2% to 3% per download if the app is downloaded through their stores.”

With TrainHeroic I would just have to pay for the amount of people on my subscription. So for 1000 subscriber that would be $399.99/mo, correct?

With TrainHeroic:

1. Can I pick my own prices for monthly subscriptions?

2. In addition to subscriptions, can I do “One-Time Purchase” as well, like in the case of selling a E-Book?

3. Can I upload Nutrition Plans like I would be able to do in Playbook?

4. Do you charge 2-3% per download if the app is downloaded through the Apple or Google Store?

5. What are your rates after 1000 subscribers?



Thanks!"

Password change not working,"Hello,

I am struggling to reset my password, I've reset the password through the link and when I go to sign back in, the password is rejected. 

I made the mistake of combining the same email that I use for my Coaching account and my own athlete account. Now i can't log in to my marketplace account.  
Would love some help on this matter. If you guys could delete my athlete account and keep my marketplace account open, that would be great.


Thank you!

TrainHeroic Marketplace is Now Enabled,"Hello, 

I have created a program that is designed for multiple athletes to use as a recurring subscription. 
In order to have a link to share to my social media, where they can click the link & purchase the program-- do I need to be on marketplace to have this feature?  
 
I believe right now, I have to manually add them as an athlete with their email and then add them to the TEAM. 

I would appreciate any help/feedback with this! Thank you!

Re: Transaction Receipt from TrainHeroic,"Good morning,
Excited to get started, however I have found it extremely difficult to navigate the Trainheroic desktop. I realise i am older and use a ton of apps, but with my training i like to see it on a larger calender and use my desktop. I can see the Jumpship training on my mobile app, however i want to see it on my desktop, so i can see i on larger scale better. On the desktop however the only training i am seeing is the trainheroic programs. I have created a new team and tried to add the JS programming, however it is not available. 

What is the easiest way so that i can see the training on a weekly view via my desktop and not my phone? 

Thanks, look forward to hearing from you.

Account help,"Hello team,

I was hoping I could get some assistance with my account.

I currently have an account as an athlete and was looking to open up an account as a coach. It won't let me create an account with the same email unfortunately. Is there a way to make a profile that is an athlete and transform it into a coaching profile or would I have to delete the athlete profile and lose my subscription to my program?

Any help is appreciated.

Thank you,

I'm looking to advertise my team on the marketplace (on a recurring membership) but I'm concerned that some of those I'm marketing to will not want to pay in USD. What do you suggest for these people? is there a way to charge in GPB? Or if not, can I sell separately and pay train heroic via my athlete list? in that case what would you suggest for keeping track of whether peoples memberships remain active etc?

I hope that makes sense.

Many thanks :)

* Marketplace - New Program Sale

Does that include team sales too?  I assume it does, but just want to double check, because everywhere else it's pretty deliberate about specifying the difference between programs and teams.

Thanks.

Alright, Heroes, this month we're talking shoulders, feet and abs. We've got six ways to keep those oft-injured shoulders healthy. Have you been working out with naked feet? Might be something to dip your toes into. Plus, don't sleep on those obliques for power-packed abs. Let's get after it!

Shoulder injuries are the most commonly injured area for athletes. Check out these six exercises to help prevent injuries around life and training.

Foot mechanics are an increasingly hot topic in modern athletics. More athletes are discovering the pitfalls of shoes and the benefits of being able to use their feet properly. Maybe barefoot training has been on your radar, but where do you start?

Request for 4-Month Free Trial to Evaluate TrainHeroic with 10 Clients,"Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to request the possibility of a 4-month free trial to explore and evaluate your platform, TrainHeroic.

As I’m currently growing my business as a personal trainer, I would love to utilize TrainHeroic to manage and track my clients. To fully assess whether this tool suits my long-term needs, I would kindly ask for a free trial allowing me to manage up to 10 clients during this 4-month period.

Should my client base exceed this limit, I would be more than happy to transition to a paid plan. My goal is to experience the platform in real-world conditions to make an informed decision moving forward.

I greatly appreciate your consideration of my request, and I am available to provide any further information if needed.

Thank you in advance for your time.

Project Bellplex Program- Bundles are here!,"Hey guys!

We have chatted before about how I do not do my billing through you, I am waiting to potentially do that when bundles are available.

I am running into some situations where people think they have cancelled their membership and payments, but really what they are doing is just taking the program workouts off their calendar. 

When they do this, they get a message/email from you that they have ""successfully cancelled their membership to Project Bellplex"" - which technically isn't the case and that is where the confusion comes into play.

I was wondering if it was possible for ME to get an email or some sort of notice when people do this so I can then confirm with them and make sure they know what happened?

Thanks,

- They are hosted in vimeo and the links are correct.
- It's not an issue with vimeo as I can click through on the desktop and every video works.
- It is happening across multiple devices across different countries so it's not a setting I can change on a phone or anything. 

This is a big issue as clients can't view the movements I'm writing for them and if I can't get this sorted soon, I'll have to consider moving to a different platform.

Moving Athletes to Different Teams,"Hi there,

I am in the process of organizing my Marketplace Teams as I am getting busier, and I need to move some Athletes around.

I have asked them to send an e-mail but don't believe they have been helped out yet. I need this change to be done ASAP as they begin their new specific programs soon.

My business is Stephenson Athletics and I am looking to move the following Athletes:

Jonah Marshall (jonahtmarshall@gmail.com) to OFF-ICE ONLINE TRAINING

Spencer Chestolowski (chestolowskispencer@gmail.com) to OFF-ICE ONLINE TRAINING

Mark Buckwold (markbuckwold@gmail.com) to PRIVATE GROUP TRAINING

Printing Issues,"“Because we don't limit coaches in how long a session can be, it's possible that more lengthy sessions may not fit on one sheet. If you're printing 4 sessions on a sheet, there are instances when the some of the session won't actually fit within one of the day's columns.” is written on your page.

Can't you extend the print on the other side, back side of the paper? It makes the printing service unusable for me.

Thank you."

Hi Mary,

We want to extend our sincere gratitude for your participation in the TrainHeroic Coach Referral Program. Your support has been invaluable in helping us grow our community of dedicated coaches.

Here's what this means for you today and in the coming weeks:

* Referral Submissions: All referrals occuring before September 23rd will be processed as usual. If you have any pending referrals, they will be reviewed and rewarded according to the program’s guidelines.
* Referral Commissions: All approved commissions will be paid out by October 24th. If you are owed commission, you must provide us your PayPal email to receive payment. To add your PayPal, follow these steps:

I hope this message finds you well. 

I am writing to follow up on the cancellation of my membership with Quantum Gymnastics, which I did through the app two months ago. Unfortunately, I have noticed that my membership was not cancelled as expected, and I have continued to be charged for the last two months. 

I have provided details of the two most recent transactions, as well as a message to the coach Jade indicating my decision to quit the program. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and ensure that my membership is cancelled moving forward, along with a refund for the incorrect charges.

Thank you for your attention to this, and I look forward to your response.

General Info,"Hi guys,

I'm looking to use TrainHeroic for my online programming, I just have a few questions:

1. Does the price increase automated in relation to number of users (i.e. no fuss my end?)

2. Can TrainHeroic be linked to Shopify from a sales perspective - i.e. link straight to programs from purchase screen?

3. Can pdf. documents be linked to programs - i.e. nutrition guides, tracker forms, etc.?

4. If you start the free trial to get a feel for the software, is there automatic billing at the end of 7 days? (Hopefully not!)

5. Is there any training guides linked to the software for first-time users? i.e. guides on how to put programs together easily for beginners?

6. Does the software include varied training modalities (1rm weight percentages per set, Intervals/Tabatas, EMOM, AMRAP, etc)?


Many thanks!

Phil."

If the account payment is not received, account access will automatically be removed 7 days after your renewal date on 10/4/24.  Please keep us in the loop as to your plans so we can avoid that.

Referral Attribution,"We use Referral Rock for managing affiliate sales referrals. As part of this, each user is provided with a unique link that relates to their specific account.

When someone sigs up through TH, we need to be able to pass the information back to Referral Rock to handle referral payouts. We were intending to do this through you Zapier integration.

However, when trying to set this up, there seems to be no way to attribute a custom code to a TH user, and subsequently no way to pass referral information back through Zapier with what that was for accurate sales attribution. When we look at the data being passed through the Zapier trigger, this information seems to be limited to just Fist/Last Name, Email Address and Team Name.

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Hi there,


This morning I sent you an email requesting that you refund my recent subscription renewal to John Rusins training program.

Your email platform auto generated an FAQ page, and I read through the links. 

Here is where I'm at. 

Prior to TrainHeroic charging my credit card I had tried to figure out how to cancel my annual renewal, and also tried to figure out when it was going to renew. 

Obviously I was not able to get this figured out before my CC was charged for another year if training. 

I found this frustrating. I've made many TrainHeroic training program purchases through the Apple App Store and it's seamless to cancel  subscriptions, and to see renewal dates.

As a business owner, I am disappointed that your platform does not send out a courtesy email prior to charging for annual renewals. I think that's bad business. An annual renewal is a BIG purchase.

I think if you have the ability to send out an FAQ explaining that you don't typically do refunds, you also have the ability to send out a courtesy email prior to customers credit cards being charged hundreds of dollars.

I believe you should give me a refund based on my reasons above. I want you to know that I've used TrainHeroic for a number of years, as does my husband and three of my kids. We, as a family, spend a lot of money on your platform. I want to train with a different training program this year and I'm frustrated that I've just been backed up against the wall based on poor communication.

Thank you for considering my unique circumstance, and taking into consideration that my family and I have been loyal customers of your app. I think that should count for something. 

Best regards,

Andrea Johnson"

Thank you for your feedback!,"Hello. Great app! My one request is when I’m in the list view and tap on an exercise in list view, bring me to that actual exercise not to the first exercise in the group. I typically check out my work out in list view and want to click on specific exercises so I can quickly get to the video and watch it.

Example :

If I tap A3 on the list screen below, it then takes me to the top of A group of exercises. I want it to take me straight to the A3 exercise because that’s what I tapped.

Hey Margaret,

 

You might be facing two challenges training remotely:

1. You miss the competition of lifting in the gym, seeing how much weight your peers are moving. We get it, competition is a great motivator. 
2.

You're not sure how to manage your recovery. And you're told your habits outside the gym are just as important as the work you put in at the gym.

If you resonate with either or both of those statements, check out the features below.

StackUp

Compete everyday, in your own way. View global leaderboards and see how your lifts compare to other athletes just like you. We'll even surface what it takes to move up on the leaderboard by adding just 5-10 lbs to your last performance. 

Readiness Insights

Manage your recovery with the same attention you give to your training. Monitor your stress, sleep, mood, & soreness patterns so you can be more aware of behaviors & lifestyle factors impacting your training. 

StackUp & Readiness Insights are Pro tools. Upgrade your subscription directly in-app.

TrainHeroic Marketplace is Now Enabled,"Hi Rodrigo,

Your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!

**By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:**


1. **Use your own custom programming.** Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
2. **Keep your programming up to date.** You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
3. **Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions.** If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
4. **Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.**

**Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (****full explanation here****):**


- Any Team or Program sales that _we_ direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
- Team subscription sales generated through _your_ attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.

  - _*Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE_
- Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
- **For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for** _**your**_ **self-driven sales, check out this article:** **Marketplace Matching and Attributions**
- You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.

**Next steps: **
When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our **Guide to Building Your Sales page**.

*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.

Cancellation request,"Hello,

I signed up for a free trial, but I don't think that I'm going to require this service. I have software for home exercise programs already that likely will fit this need. 

Thank you for the trial. Please let me know how to proceed to ensure that I do not get billed when my trial ends.

Effective September 23rd, we will be sunsetting individual referral links.


Hi BIRTHFIT,

We want to extend our sincere gratitude for your participation in the TrainHeroic Coach Referral Program. Your support has been invaluable in helping us grow our community of dedicated coaches.

We're always striving to improve the experience for our coaches. For that reason, we're going to be changing the structure of our referral program going forward, starting with sunsetting the use of individual referral links.

Here's what this means for you today and in the coming weeks:

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Good morning,

I was given a code for 50% off on Train Heroic for the first month, I put in the code, it was applied and when I click pay it charge me the full $30.

I have not used the new app and told Josh I want to cancel and receive a full refund of $30.

I have yet to heard back from him as of this morning.

It is extremely frustrating not being able to get ahold of anyone, I just left another voice mail this morning on (612) 567-9162.

It is also extremely frustrating not being able to just make a phone call and actually speak to someone.  

Can someone please contact me

If I invite him to a team, will he be prompted to set up his monthly billing I have set up for the team or do I need to do something else specifically for that? I've allowed the team to sell on my marketplace, but It's not showing up when I type in my marketplace page link.

Coaching/Military,"Hello,



My name is John, and I have been using Train Heroic on and off. I love the app and would like to use it for my work. I am Active in the US Army and was curious if you had any deals/promotions or some offers for the military. I will not be using this app to make money but to track the progress of my Soldiers and help create better workout programs for them. I would appreciate any help that you can bring.

Hi there!! Sooo I cancelled and then changed my mind.
Do you know how to re-subscribe? My current subscription runs out Oct 8, and when I go into my account to purchase paragon (from the paragon site), it says “already subscribed.” Sorry for the hassle 🤨

Hey Ariel, 

Thanks for reaching out! We’re bummed to see you go! Is there anything I can do to help you?

Cancellations are hosted in app and managed by members. 

How to cancel:

1.

Click the Training Tab

2.

Click the filter button on the top left

3.

Click Manage

4.

Click the Trash Can Icon next to “Paragon (All Access)” (or whichever Bundle you are subscribed to)

You can confirm your subscription was canceled, because underneath the bundle the text will now say “Expires on XX/XX/XX” and the trash can is no longer visible.

This will not work if you hit the trash cans next to individual programs, and you will continue to get an error code,

This can be done at any time, and you will have access through the remainder of your paid period. I do not have the ability to do this for you.


^^ this is what it will look like when you cancel. 


Let me know if you have any questions!

Re: Billing update for Initial Attack (CPAT Prep/ Beginner) subscription.,"Hello!

For some reason I always had the Heavy Set and CPAT beginner prep on my account. I’m now left with Heavy Set, not CPAT beginner prep. 

Can you please switch it so I have CPAT beginner prep instead of the Heavy Set?

I just want to confirm I wasn’t being charged twice for the programs.

Thanks!

I was wondering about your team **Strong Surf Club (Gym Edition).** It appears you do not have programming on the team calendar after tomorrow.

Authorization request / Unauthorized image use - Case no: F8984A
Dear TrainHeroic, Inc.,
We, COPYTRACK, are writing to you on behalf of our client Oskanov, who has assigned us the monitoring and protection of their licenses and image rights globally. On August 25, 2024 we have been informed that TrainHeroic, Inc. is likely using an image without permission and the client has exclusively commissioned us with the clarification, administration of the image rights and, if necessary, the enforcement of any copyright infringement through our partner lawyers. Images are protected by copyright law and infringements are actionable under international law and the respective national law. Please see the attachment below for details.
On behalf of our client, we must first determine if you have a valid license to use the images in question. If you have a valid license or any other legal justification to use these images, please reply to this email and include proof of license purchase and/or any other necessary information to validate the usage.

Please note that you are obliged to provide the necessary information about the usage of the image to allow us to verify the lawfulness of such usage.

You would then be legally obligated to compensate our client for the damage caused by this copyright infringement.

Team Subscriptions,"Hey guys ,

I'm curious as to why such a big percentage was taken from my payout this last month. I was understanding anyone I had as a lead sign up only a $1 fee + 2.9% + .30 would be taken. It looks like you guys took almost 30% of the sign up fee. Can you explain this to me please? How do you differentiate my leads for the program that sign up vs ones you guys have directed to my site. All 4 people that have subscribed I know personally. So I am confused as to why such a big percentage was taken. Can you fix this for me or explain why such a big percentage was taken...?

Client attribution - thank you,"Hi,

I was wondering if you could help me with a client attribution for Ruth Pankl. Her attribution is currently the TrainHeroic default, but she was a current 1:1 client of mine who joined a team. You can see she joined TrainHeroic around July 8, and moved into The Works S&C in August.

I sent a link via TrainHeroic messages with my attribution link (screenshot below) but maybe she purchased it directly.

Anyway - just wondering if you could adjust that.

Thanks so much!

You'll finid instruction on how to cancel within the app here (https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18170938101645-How-do-I-cancel-my-team-membership-or-subscription-) 👈

I just noticed that i have been charged for several months but had gone cancelled several months ago. im not sure if it didnt go through or what happened there but I havent used it for 3 months now and have been charged. I was wondering if there was anyway to be refunded that and cancel my coaching account. I have absolutely loved using trainheroic for several years as a head coach with the gym and as well as for personal clients and myself. But after a career change I just wont be using it anymore and hopefully be able to get the money back for this past summer.

Thanks for everything,

<p dir=""auto"">Hi. So apparently there have been changes in our national regulations here in Sweden which makes it so that the payment for my subscription cannot be drawn by you guys unless I manually open up my card for online transactions. Problem is that I can't know when you guys will draw the fee so I can't “time” it (opening up the card only lasts one hour). What other payment options do you guys have that would be suitable?</p>

Marketplace Payments,"Hello!

So I've recently started selling in the marketplace and whilst having a chat with my accountant we discussed my ‘customers' location' through the marketplace. This is important for us for the sake of tax law and making sure we have accurate information on how much VAT to declare etc.

I dont think I can see this information through the ‘analytics’ tab, so I wondered how I can access this information for the sake of legal accounting? I'm sure you've had a few questions similar to this in the past.

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Good day. I accidentally clicked to buy the GBS program today. The description said a 7-day trial period, but it charged me $50. I had previously purchased programs from you, so I was already logged in with a credit card assigned, and the money was charged to me right away. I would like to withdraw from this. My email has an account assigned to it. Is this possible? I don't know what caused this error, but I definitely didn't want to buy a paid subscription right away, just a 7-day trial period.

Hey Laura,

Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to pause your account in TrainHeroic, you can cancel and re-sign up when you're ready! Additionally, we have the option for you to join the “community only” membership for $10 a month. This allows you to stay in the Facebook group, and preserve your grandfathered monthly rate. I will leave the cancellation instructions below:

Cancellations are hosted in app and managed by members. 

How to cancel:

1.

Click the Training Tab

2.

Click the filter button on the top left

3.

Click Manage

4.

Click the Trash Can Icon next to “Paragon (All Access)” (or whichever Bundle you are subscribed to)

You can confirm your subscription was canceled, because underneath the bundle the text will now say “Expires on XX/XX/XX” and the trash can is no longer visible.

This will not work if you hit the trash cans next to individual programs, and you will continue to get an error code,

This can be done at any time, and you will have access through the remainder of your paid period. I do not have the ability to do this for you.

Inquiry About Implementing TrainHeroic at My Fitness Studio,"Dear TrainHeroic Team,

My name is Bryan Rodriguez, and I have been using TrainHeroic for the past five years to train my online clients and for personal training. I’ve recently opened a fitness studio in Bilbao Spain, The Smart Fit Life, and I’m very interested in using TrainHeroic as the primary platform for my in-person clients.

With our membership expected to reach at least 50 members, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how TrainHeroic can be effectively implemented in a gym setting. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the following:

* The benefits and challenges of using TrainHeroic in a gym environment.
* The process of delivery and presentation, such as using tablets on racks versus individual members using their phones.
* The cost structure for this setup.
* Features such as onboarding for both my clients and myself.

Although my studio has just opened, I am aiming for an official launch of TrainHeroic integration by October. Therefore, I would like to begin the onboarding process by mid to late September.

Could we arrange a meeting to discuss these details? I am eager to learn more and collaborate with TrainHeroic to offer the best possible experience for my clients.

My current account is listed under another email which I would also like to change. My current TrainHeroic email address is thesmartfit1@gmail.com, but would like to change it and set it to info@thesmartfitlife.com. 

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your reply.

TrainHeroic - Updating Your Billing Info,"Hello TrainHeroic! My 2 nephews have a TrainHeroic account. I coached them both 1:1. Their grandparents want to purchase them the program I built that is in the marketplace, HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL IN-SEASON TRAINING.

I updated our billing but when I did all of our assistant coaches were kicked off. In the past, we were allowed 5 free assistant coaches, is this still true or is this no longer an option? I have a few coaches that need access to their workouts for their personal training clients so trying to figure that out.

Also, I noticed that our log in e-mail address for our main account is a very old e-mail that we no longer use. Right now it is d1cosprings@gmail.com and our current email is d1coloradosprings@gmail.com, is there a way to change this?

If I add an athlete to my team do they get access to it without having to put in payment details? We already have around 15 clients on our subscription via stripe payments, so would ideally keep them on this and just add them without having to take payment details again.

Then any new clients if we just link them to the marketplace via one of our attribution links then they add payment details and that's all done through paypal via trainheroic with fees etc. Is this  correct?

Hi Kevork, I'm sorry for the trouble and I'd like to help get things back on track!

I've logged into your account, and I'm not experiencing any issues, so I'd like to figure out what might be causing us to have different experiences. Often times this just means a couple updates and steps to clear cache should do the trick.

Can you please try the steps below?

1. Be sure that you are logging into your coach account from a computer and not an ipad as an ipad will not support the full functionality of TrainHeroic for coaches.
2. Update your Google Chrome browser<https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en>
3. Clear out your Cache/history/cookies<https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95589?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en> (choose the timeframe 'All Time')

Just a heads up that you may also need to update your computer software in order to run the latest version of Google Chrome.

Can you let me know if you're still experiencing any trouble after following the steps above?

Should I add each athlete to my roster as one or still do it as a team? If I do it as a team can I go to each athlete's calendar individually to add their specific warmup afterwards?

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Marc,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thank you for reaching out. I am sorry to hear you have gone through a family bereavement.
<br>At this time, I am unable to push out your coach trial again. Please purchase a paid coach account. You can do the 1 athlete coach account for $9.99. This way you will be able to fully use all the coach features for your account.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">With that, in order for your athletes to utilize the platform, they are able to download the free TrainHeroic app and track their progress that way. You will need a coach account that can hold 700 athletes. If you wish to set that up, please let me know. We do not have an option to limit the coach access you obtain with the coach app.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Alex , my apologies , we’ve just had a family bereavement . Can we start this from from a week Sunday when I return back to work .</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Also I have a question : we are a big 3 story gym with around 700 members and would like to know the options to provide the app and programs to all of our members . We wouldn’t need the full coaching access tho , just the platform for us to provide programs and they can track their own workouts . Hope this makes sense</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Happy to help! Please reach out next month and I can activate the free coach trial for you. With that, at this time we do not offer a way to personalize the app with your logo. It is something we are looking into for future planning. You can definitely upload your own videos to use.

<p dir=""auto"">Marc, thanks for reaching out!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I went ahead and added a free 14-day trial of CoachHeroic to your existing athlete account so that you can get started with things right away. No credit card is required and you'll only be charged if you choose to sign up for a paid account.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Note that you'll want to log in from a computer to utilize the full range of coaching features. Click HERE&lt;<a href=""http://athlete.trainheroic.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://athlete.trainheroic.com/</a>&gt; to login and be sure to use Chrome for the best experience.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">You can still log your own sessions from the app now that you're a coach. In case you need it, the blue link here will go over how to do this in-app: As a coach, how do I log sessions for myself?&lt;<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156584562445-As-a-coach-how-do-I-log-sessions-for-myself-"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156584562445-As-a-coach-how-do-I-log-sessions-for-myself-</a>&gt;</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thank you for reaching out.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Happy to help! Please reach out next month and I can activate the free coach trial for you. With that, at this time we do not offer a way to personalize the app with your logo. It is something we are looking into for future planning. You can definitely upload your own videos to use. You can use either YouTube or Vimeo URL to add videos to your coach account to have ready to upload to your athletes.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Marc, thanks for reaching out!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I went ahead and added a free 14-day trial of CoachHeroic to your existing athlete account so that you can get started with things right away. No credit card is required and you'll only be charged if you choose to sign up for a paid account.</p>

I would like to ask about how I can switch the program selling type from ""one time payment"" to ""monthly subscription""? Right now I only see the one time payment option. Please help me with this.

Missing Programming,"Hi Cate,

I hope you are doing well.

It has been brought to our attention that there hasn't been any programming on your marketplace team, **Gym Jones Tactical | Train Like a SEAL**, since **September 21 2024**. With that, I do not see any programming for the month of October. Could you please let me know if there should be programming on the calendar for October or if you could share an insight with the layout of the team subscription.

Standing by"
Matt Marcoe,"Hey TrainHeroic!

Can you please tell me if athlete Matt Marcoe is on a paid or comped subscription? his email is: cmnt33@icloud.com


Let me know please.

Liability insurance,"Good Afternoon!
I was wondering if you could help me with some more suggestions on professional liability insurance. I’ve tried the 3 you had listed on your site and others but none will insure me because I am not meeting with clients in person or doing live zoom calls. I want to sell premade workouts for purchase. I thought insurance would be the easy part:) Do you know if others doing the pre made workout have insurance or do they just count on their waiver? Thank you for any help!

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Patrick,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thank you for the reply and screenshot. Your internet speed is fast enough to load the credit card screen.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I have one other user from Lebanon that is having the same problem. I would be surprised, but I wonder it is being blocked for some reason.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I know this may be difficult, because you are on the other side of the planet, but I am willing to enter your card on my side. We could do a quick video call via Google Meet. I am available today, if you want to try it. Otherwise, give me a few times that would work for you. I can send you an invite. I am in Mountain Standard Time in the US. The best time for me is in the morning and it will be the evening for you.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Youssef,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I am sorry this problem continues and I haven't been able to get it resolved. So you can program for your athletes, I have started another 14-day trial for you.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Where are you located? We have seen this for some international users. Also, can you perform a internet speed test and send me a screenshot of the results? I recommend this site&lt;<a href=""https://www.speedtest.net/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.speedtest.net/</a>&gt;, because you can pick a server in Denver. This will help rule out possible causes.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thank you for your patience while work through this together.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Youssef,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I am sorry this problem continues and I haven't been able to get it resolved. So you can program for your athletes, I have started another 14-day trial for you.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Where are you located? We have seen this for some international users. Also, can you perform a internet speed test and send me a screenshot of the results? I recommend this site&lt;<a href=""https://www.speedtest.net/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.speedtest.net/</a>&gt;, because you can pick a server in Denver. This will help rule out possible causes.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thank you for your patience while work through this together.</p>

I subscribed to the Basecamp:Season Prep program and paid the $85 but apparently my email or something was entered incorrectly because I am unable to sign into the app.  Even chose the ""forgot password"" option and put my email in and nothing happened. Not sure how to proceed at this time.

Yoke Squad/Garage Gangsters,"This is a follow-up to your previous request #733542 ""ANGELA CARBONI""

<div class=""zd-comment"" dir=""auto""><p dir=""auto"">Hello! </p>

<p dir=""auto"">I have been a proud Yoke Squad member since its inception and will likely stay forever. 😃</p>

<p dir=""auto"">At the moment, my work schedule dictates the opportunity of a different gym, but one that’s less-equipped: I was wondering if it’d be possible for me to have the option to see the Garage Gangsters program for a week or so while remaining a Yoke Squad member so I can make an informed decision. </p>

<p dir=""auto"">I understand this is an odd request. Assuredly, I’ll be staying with the TH program regardless and want to stay in Yoke; I just want to ensure I’m making the best decision with access to equipment shifting for a bit. </p>

<p dir=""auto"">Many, many thanks for your kind consideration. </p>

Hey Me,

 

You have fitness goals. And you have a plan in place. So now it's your time to reach your potential. 

 

One of the most frustrating parts of training is putting the work in and not seeing progress or results. We can fix that. 

 

By following your training plan and logging your workouts, you will see exactly how you're progressing, hitting PR's, and staying on track with your goals. 

 

So get to it and be sure to log your workout so you can track those gains. If you need help using the app, watch the short video.

I currently prescribe to home gym physique 5-day, but I may be joining a commercial gym as well to have access to machines I don't have at home.  My intent is to work out at home some days, but also the gym mostly for leg days.  What would be your recommendation for choice of programming?  Would it make sense to choose full gym physique and modify as needed on home gym days, or vice versa?

Today, I received an email saying that TrainHeroic charged me an additional $25. May I ask why I was charged twice? 

Thank you.

Train Heroic Attribution Link Question,"Hello, my name is Tommy and I've got a few questions regarding payments via Train Heroic that I did not see on the help directory pages:

1. Is it possible to see how many team/program sales came from my own attribution links vs. marketplace directed traffic? I just had my first payment from TrainHeroic for my online sales but it seemed extremely low and many of the people who bought my programs are directly from my instagram. So I was just wondering if there's a way I can access data to where most of my sales are coming from and track it myself?

2. If a sale was made through Train Heroic Marketplace for one of my Team Subscriptions, does Train Heroic take 30% of the sale for just the first month when the original conversion was made? Or if that athlete decides to stick with me for a year, does Train Heroic take 30% of that specific athlete's sale for all 12 months of the year?

3. What is technically considered my own attribution link? I have links directed from my own personal website along with LinkTree links from all my social medias. I clicked the link on the directory page that describes exactly what are considered attribution links, but when I clicked the link it said the page does not exist.

If someone could clear these up for me that would be awesome so that I know exactly now this works as my programs continue to grow.

Thank You!

Tommy"
app chat,"Hi, I have a problem with the chat tool in the app. The first 12 weeks I was able to chat with my coach, but now I cannot find the chat anymore. So I am not able to communicate with him. When I am writing via the feed tool when I am logged into the program on my computer, he cannot see my messages. Can you blease help me? Kind regards, Nadja"
Adding Back Programs,"Hi Train Heroic,

 

I had an unlimited subscription to Johnnie Wod (JWOD) and Grindstone. These are PowerAthlete programs. You can review my profile and see that the administrator added me to these teams without a monthly or yearly subscription fee. I thought I was silencing notifications and I ended up deleting both programs. Are these programs able to be added back to my training plans?

 

Thank you so much.

Support help with TrainHeroic program,"Hello, I'm writing on his behalf (coach@jakubbucko.com) about some ambiguities to discuss. I wrote them below, please feel free to explain me all the points:

1) It's possible to have the ""check-out"" for training plan's payment in currency other than USD (We would need the EUR). If yes, please let me know, where we can change it.

2) How does the integration with PayPal work (Jakub has a business account, they wanted just an email address, but we need to know who issues invoices and how it works, when we can expect the invoice etc.? 

3) If a person who purchases a spot on Teams will have access to two different workout plans at the same time, and he/she can switch between them comfrotely each week or how does it  work? It's possible that the app is tracking his progress no matter what exercises / plan he/she is working on at the moment?

Jakub Bucko was writing to you before. He is planning a big project so we're expecting to gradually grow past 100 people and will probably tackle higher capacity as well.

Thank you very much for your explanation. We really appreciate it so much!

New Password,"Hello,
I tried getting the necessary support through the support bot but didn't quite find out how to do what I need so:
I'm trying to help my client Hunter Salo.
You will see he's in TH as an athlete and I have been training him in person, putting his program in TH weekly, and just using TH on my own on an ipad to track his progress.
He likely accepted the invite to TH a long time ago but really never uses the app.
I did in the past have him on a ""team"" so that my other coach and I could share his programming access but I currently only program him as an individual 
Anyway, I'm away for a bit so I gave him a couple workouts to do at home.  He couldn't see the programming and brought up the following issues (I wasn't with him to look at his screen so it's difficult to know if there was a quick fix to this):

* He said he needs the access code to see his training.  (again on his individual calendar...not team).  How do I find and send the code? I know it was sent at time of invitation but I don't know how to find it later.
* He said his email is no longer the one shown but is:   hunter4salo@gmail.com

Please let me know how I can help him with these issues.
Thank you.

Great to meet today! ,"Hi Pere,

Thanks for taking the time to meet today! You're off to a great start with your TH account. Once you're able to create the sales page and sell to athletes**,** things will really start to get rolling.

First of all, attached you will find the video recording of our meeting for reference.

And to recap, here is a list of your next steps to get things up and running:

- Create the programs you want to sell in the Marketplace and have all the sessions made and completed.
- Create the sales page in the page designer.
- Set a price and go live.
- Place attribution link in you social media sites and websites.

Below are links to articles that I think you might find helpful, based on what we went over.

**Marketplace Articles:**
Marketplace Seller Terms & Payment Information
For Coaches: Marketplace Matching, Attributions, and Affiliate Links
Guide to Building Your Sales Page
And, here is our link to submit any feedback or feature requests: TrainHeroic Customer Feedback

I'll check in in a couple of weeks to see how things are going. In the meantime, the fastest way to get questions answered is by emailing support@trainheroic.com or clicking HERE.

**And Pere, we genuinely value your insights! I'd be very appreciative if you would share how your onboarding experience went in our quick feedback survey** **here****.**

All the best getting started!"

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Matt,

<br>I hope you're doing well. The engineering team has informed me that the issue you're encountering stems from a compatibility concern between Cloudflare Turnstile and the iOS platform. They have kindly asked if you could try the steps outlined in this GitHub link: <a href=""https://github.com/marsidev/react-turnstile/issues/60"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/marsidev/react-turnstile/issues/60</a> to see if it helps resolve the issue.
<br> 
<br>I do understand that your primary role is to upload videos to the app, and that you're not the app owner. With that in mind, I would kindly suggest reaching out to the app owner and encouraging them to ensure that they are using WebView and following the instructions provided in the link above. This might offer a pathway to addressing the problem.
<br> 
<br>Regarding your request for a refund, we sincerely apologize for any frustration this situation has caused. Our refund policy extends up to 15 days for the annual plan, and I see that, unfortunately, your purchase has exceeded this window.

A little bit about each program:

The BRAND NEW Pregnant Athlete Training Program

Pregnant or about to be?

This program was created to support your training from the moment you find out you are pregnant until the day you deliver.

The Pregnant Athlete Training Program is a well-structured strength and conditioning program that evolves with you through each week of your pregnancy. It connects the dots between core + pelvic health considerations and your long-term fitness interests and goals. It is the perfect blend of strength, hypertrophy, and metcons.

The brand-new program includes:
➡️ New programming
➡️ New videos + demos + education
➡️ A core & pelvic floor prehab series with a PFPT
➡️ An app to make accessing and tracking workouts easy

The 8-Week Postpartum Athlete Training Program.

Newly postpartum or at the end stages of pregnancy?

Having a baby is a big deal and a postpartum body is healing, adapting, and transitioning with each precious week!

Program Includes:

* 8 Weeks of Workouts
* Newly recorded video demos + coaching for each movement

TrainHeroic Marketplace is Now Enabled,"Hi, “Train Heroic” team!


I want to gain access to the platform marketplace. I am preparing a small training bundle for training “anywhere,” including straps, resistance bands, etc., and I would like my clients to get access to a program within the TH app with a free trial period. 

Could you tell me if the TH Marketplace is the right solution?

I was also thinking of asking them for an email and adding them to my account and team with a pre-assigned program. The downside that I would like to avoid is that I would need to manually add every individual and eventually adjust my subscription type (due to the variability of people on and off). 

I hope that makes sense to you, and I’d be happy to hear what you think.

Best,

Duplicate Account Refund,"Hi Cody,

I hope you enjoyed the Labor Day weekend.  Just reaching out to let you know about an athlete that has a duplicate account and has been paying for LHSF - Home Gym twice each month.

His name is Rick Panara (panaranick@yahoo.com).  You emailed us about a problem with his account at the end of July.  At that time, we did not see he had a duplicate account, so the double payments continued.

He emailed us on Saturday to bring the charges to our attention.  So you are aware, I have canceled one of his subscriptions and refunded him $38 from the most recent transaction.  You will see that in your analytics.

Let me know if you have any questions and have a great day!"

<div class=""zd-comment"" dir=""auto""><p dir=""auto"">﻿Hello!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I have been a proud Yoke Squad member since its inception and will likely stay forever. 😃</p>

<p dir=""auto"">At the moment, my work schedule dictates the opportunity of a different gym, but one that’s less-equipped: I was wondering if it’d be possible for me to have the option to see the Garage Gangsters program for a week or so while remaining a Yoke Squad member so I can make an informed decision.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I understand this is an odd request. Assuredly, I’ll be staying with the TH program regardless and want to stay in Yoke; I just want to ensure I’m making the best decision with access to equipment shifting for a bit.</p>

We would use eastmanhighperformancecentre@gmail.com as the main account.

Can you assist with logistics and getting started. 

Specifically we have to get moving soon as we have a dryland program to create for our regional aaa hockey squads in our area. That will be 150 players right away so would like our new trainer to start creating that programming and familiarizing herself with TH functionality 

Many thanks.

Hello! 

Thank you so much for checking in. I love the programming, I enjoy being able to see the workouts in advance, and I LOVE being able to work hard in my first trimester while still knowing I'm not doing anything that will negatively impact my health during pregnancy! 

I am wondering if it is possible to retroactively apply the 25% discount to my purchase of the program. There was a sale going on when I purchased the program but I got so excited and forgot to apply the discount code! Honestly, I would pay full price for this, given the importance to me, but it would be great to get this applied given I purchased it during a sale. 

Thank you so much!

<p dir=""auto"">The charge that is trying to go through is for $247.50 USD. This is the Black Friday discounted amount for a year-long subscription to Yoke Squad.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">The system will try to charge you for two more days. If the payment doesn't go through by then and the subscription gets canceled, just shoot me an email and I'll be happy to help you reactivate.</p>

Trans Masc Youth Trainer,"Hi,

My son, E.D., is 16 and to date, has only socially transitioned. He is thinking of starting on hormones in about a year. 

To help with his discomfort in his body and support his fencing practice (he’s been a regular fencer with Tim Moorhouse Fencing for 2+ years) he’d like to start weight training. 

Might we set up time to chat further and maybe even have you chat with E.D. to see if he may be a good fit for your personal training program?

Thanks,

Tobi

Re: Get ready to smash your first training session,"Hello, 







I wanted to create a coach account with you, but unfortunately it didn't 
work and I started a pro account. D.kadrle@seznam.cz was my account and I 
paid for a year's membership, but I had to cancel it because it didn't work,
so I'm asking for a refund.







 Unfortunately, I had to create a new account at the email address kadak1.2.
3@seznam.cz, where the coach account already works normally.







 Thank you and best regards, 







Daniel Kadrle

I hope you are well and enjoyed the Labor Day weekend!

Just reaching out to let you know Katie Reimer, reimerkfit@gmail.com, did not want to pay for the annual subscription to Form & Function.  I canceled that subscription and refunded her $490.

Then, I resubscribed her to the monthly subscription.  I did not want you to wonder what is going on with the large refund.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,"

New Password,Hi - I was signing up for a free trial when I encountered an error. My billing information was submitted but I am unable to access the account and so I'm being billed with no way to get into my account. I tried signing up originally under jennh9972@gmail.com with my card ending 6087 (just charged on 9/2). The name would be Jennifer Mobley. I then created an account with NO SUBSCRIPTION under the same email (and no billing) under the name JENNIFER M MOBLEY (with middle initial).  I am interested in an account but how can I get into the account with the actual sbuscription? I am unsure what the username/password is. Thanks

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Hey Ashley,

Thanks for reaching out and congrats on your little one :)

@TrainHeroic <support@trainheroic.com> can we please refund Ashley Croft
for her DB bundle subscription she just signed up for?


You'll have to cancel your membership in the app, Ashley. To cancel moving
forward, here are the instructions for doing so:

How to cancel:

   1.

   Click the Training Tab
   2.

   Click the filter button on the top left
   3.

   Click Manage
   4.

   Click the Trash Can Icon next to “Paragon (All Access)” (or whichever
   Bundle you are subscribed to)

You can confirm your subscription was canceled, because underneath the
bundle the text will now say “Expires on XX/XX/XX” and the trash can is no
longer visible.

This will not work if you hit the trash cans next to individual programs,
and you will continue to get an error code,

This can be done at any time, and you will have access through the
remainder of your paid period. I do not have the ability to do this for you.


^^ this is what it will look like when you cancel.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Help,"Hey Alex, 

We're really struggling to figure out how to launch this program we've created

We're running into a lot of issues with teams and athletes and programs being added or not added or altered etc


We have a program written and created on one side it shows the teams have a program...athlete joins, program doesn't show despite program being published

Is there any way to hop on a call to discuss launching? back and forth emails are hard and honestly slow for what seems like a simple fix

Descriptions ,"Hello TrainHeroic Team, I absolutely love the app but I find that I just can't work as efficiently as I'd like to.

Is there a way that a description for any given exercise can be saved and automatically added everytime that exercise has been added into any athlete's programme (with ability to edit it). Obviously I know points of performance can be saved but I feel myself constantly repeating descriptions/exercise instructions and having to either copy and paste or just type it again in different programmes.

I will add a screen shot. So, what would be ideal is if we can SAVE exercise instructions in this box here and not just the points of performance as most of my clients don't even look at that bit."

Otherwise I have to create a new exercise in my library correct?  But AIR SQUAT is already taken as name, so do I need to name it AIR SQUAT - BUILT DIFFERENT (name of my program).  Does that make sense.  That is what I did but then the exercises will say LAT PULLDOWN - BUILT DIFFERNT, or GOBLET SQUAT - BUILT DIFFERENT on the blocks in the calendar.

Here Is my situation:

This is super frustrating to have to then go find the session I was working on.

Is there an autosave feature that I can enable? Is there another way to work on sessions so they don’t disappear should I accidentally refresh the page?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

TrainHeroic Marketplace is Now Enabled,"Hi Novak,

Your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!

**By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:**


1. **Use your own custom programming.** Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
2. **Keep your programming up to date.** You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
3. **Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions.** If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
4. **Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.**

**Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (****full explanation here****):**


- Any Team or Program sales that _we_ direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
- Team subscription sales generated through _your_ attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.

  - _*Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE_
- Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
- **For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for** _**your**_ **self-driven sales, check out this article:** **Marketplace Matching and Attributions**
- You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.

**Next steps: **
When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our **Guide to Building Your Sales page**.

*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.

Hi there,
I have been loving the Jacked street program for a few months now but looking to switch it up and change program to Grindstone.

The weather is getting better I am spending more time trail running in my area. I think this Grindstone will give me great coverage but will allow that extra time to run and do my BJJ.

How do I go about switching?

Cheers,
Kane

Request for Refund and Cancellation of Training Program,"Dear TrainHeroic Support team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I recently enrolled in the Golden Era Aesthetics course, paying for a month of training. However, upon receiving the training block details, I noticed that it predominantly focuses on leg workouts. Unfortunately, this does not align with my current fitness priorities, as I was under the impression that the course would have a more balanced approach across different muscle groups.

Since there was no information provided beforehand regarding this specific focus, I kindly request a refund and cancellation of my enrollment in the program.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Davyd Kupyn

Removed program still on calendar. ,"Using a purchased program, I had begun training about 15 weeks ago.  Part way through, my schedule got derailed and I ended up deciding to start again at the beginning of the program.  I removed the program from my calendar, then added it again with my new start date.  All good for a couple weeks, but now my calendar shows both the newly begun iteration of the program, as well as the original on week 15.  The original iteration of the program doesn’t show up in my library to delete it.

I tried logging out and in.  I even deleted the app and reinstalled.  I know I can just not do the workout and in five weeks the problem will solve itself, but if I can fix it sooner, I would like to."

TrainHeroic Marketplace is Now Enabled,"Hi Alyssa,

Your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!

**By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:**


1. **Use your own custom programming.** Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
2. **Keep your programming up to date.** You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
3. **Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions.** If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
4. **Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.**

**Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (****full explanation here****):**


- Any Team or Program sales that _we_ direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
- Team subscription sales generated through _your_ attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.

  - _*Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE_
- Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
- **For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for** _**your**_ **self-driven sales, check out this article:** **Marketplace Matching and Attributions**
- You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.

**Next steps: **
When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our **Guide to Building Your Sales page**.

*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.

<p dir=""auto"">Hi André,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thanks for reaching out and I'm sorry for the trouble!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">We do see this problem with our international users and it is frustrating.  The invalid message makes it appear our billing system is not accepting your credit card, but with time and working with other users it has been determined that banks are blocking the addition of credit cards because they suspect fraud.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">When you attempt to add your card, there is an initial validation of the card in the billing system with your bank.  This is when the bank blocks the addition of the card.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I recommend speaking with your bank and ask them to lift any holds/blocks they have for TrainHeroic.  Once the block is lifted, you will be able to add your credit card to your account.  There could be tighter controls for international transactions.  If this doesn't work, you can try to use a different credit card.</p>

Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
3. **Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions.** If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
4. **Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.**

**Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (****full explanation here****):**


- Any Team or Program sales that _we_ direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
- Team subscription sales generated through _your_ attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.

  - _*Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE_
- Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
- **For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for** _**your**_ **self-driven sales, check out this article:** **Marketplace Matching and Attributions**
- You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.

**Next steps: **
When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our **Guide to Building Your Sales page**.

*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.

1. Whenever I try to delete a prescription, an error occurs (""An error occurred while deleting prescriptions.""). How do I solve this problem?
2. Is there a way to add exercises at the beginning of a workout (or somewhere in between) without having to add them at the end and move them up?

Meeting Request,"I am currently using Turnkey Coach for my personal training software and teambuildr for my team training software and google sheets/slides to create custom programs.

I would like to merge the three and use Trainheroic but would like to have a few questions answered.

1) Can I give ""video feedback"" for my 1:1 clients? If so, how would I deliver that to them? Or would I need to use Loom and message them the link?
2) Can I give session breakdown videos within the app? Similar to how a group fitness instructor would lead the beginning of a class, I would like to give a 2-5min talk on how to attack each session for my team training clients. If I am able to do this, do I deliver this within the team message board or would I need to email them separately?
3) Do you all assist in merging clients from other software (I only have 5 in Turnkey)

Would it be possible to have these answered via video call?

Thanks for your time and consideration!!

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Dear Train Heroic Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently started my Train Heroic Free Trial for 2 programs by Paul Carter, believing that I had sufficient funds to cover the cost after the free week ends. However, during the free trial week, my financial situation worsened unexpectedly, and I now find myself unable to afford the membership due to unforeseen expenses.

I have since deleted the 2 training programs from my membership account, and as it has only been a day since the renewal, I am kindly requesting a refund. 

I greatly appreciate your understanding of my circumstances and hope that you can please assist me with this. It would be super helpful to have access to those funds in my current situation, and I am hopeful that you can help me out. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Please let me know if you need any further details to process the refund.

TrainHeroic Marketplace is Now Enabled,"Hi Alberto,

Your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!

**By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:**


1. **Use your own custom programming.** Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
2. **Keep your programming up to date.** You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
3. **Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions.** If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
4. **Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.**

**Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (****full explanation here****):**


- Any Team or Program sales that _we_ direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
- Team subscription sales generated through _your_ attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.

  - _*Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE_
- Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
- **For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for** _**your**_ **self-driven sales, check out this article:** **Marketplace Matching and Attributions**
- You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.

**Next steps: **
When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our **Guide to Building Your Sales page**.

*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.

Need help cancelling,"Hello,

I joined Train Heroic in April 2024, to workout on Nick Sullivan’s workout plan. However, I had never received an activation code and had struggled with activating through the app. 
So pretty much I’ve been just paying the monthly subscription since May 2024. 

I’m not asking for any money back; I simply want to cancel any existing subscription, and cancel my membership. 
I see that Train Heroic continues to try billing my credit card, and I would like to no longer have my card billed as I would like to cancel my subscription. 

Please let me know how we can make this possible. 

Thank you. 

Respectfully,
Carlos Gracia"
I am the owner of this account. I am both a coach ...,"I am the owner of this account. I am both a coach and an athlete. I am having issues with my athlete portion. Id like to delete my history because all my lifting weight numbers are off. How do I do that without deleting my coaches account?

Example: it says that I have lifted over 400 lbs on my squats but the heaviest I've lifted is less than 200. It is like this with all my lifts therefore all my numbers are completely off.

Mobile Feedback,"Feedback: There was a quote from Slyvia Plath that showed up on my rest day screen for today.

Personally I found the quote to be extremely offensive. Since the author of that quote committed suicide, and had other disturbing topics that she would regularly write about I suggest that it would be in the best interest of Train Heroic as an app and as a brand to not include motivational quotes from Slyvia Plath going forward. I am worried that these quotes might detrimentally affect the well being of people who read them, particularly communities who are affected by suicide.

Lift History Not Showing Up,"History for certain lifts is not showing up AT ALL or it is not showing the most current history. The main example is for the bench press (""Bench Press - PHAROS"" in our library of movements). Within our Team “BUILD by Pharos” we almost always bench press on Tuesdays. We maxed out our bench press on September 3rd, 2024 and for the past three weeks have been using percentages of that max for our training. I have had a number of members show me in the app when we are doing the bench press again(exact same movement from our movements library), the listed “WORKING MAX” is either very old or not showing up at all. I even had them go back to September 3rd to show me that they input a 1RM on that day and they all did. I tried to verify this myself on my own app, so I put in my numbers for September 3rd - it shows that I am hitting a 1RM or 2RM, etc with a little trophy next to the input and even updates my working max for that day to what I had just input “245”. I even made sure to go all the way through the “day” and click on “done training” at the very end. I then went to the workout for September 10th, September, 17th, and September 24th (all days with bench press) and when I click on that portion of the workout it reports my history or LAST as “None” and there is no WORKING MAX available. I have attached pictures of what I am seeing. Please let me know what is happening and how to fix this as being able to refer easily to past Maxes, etc. is very important to members."
Issue with app,"Hi there,

Had a couple questions for you. 
1. When I go to add an exercise to a pre programmed workout that my gym loads it won’t add it into the workout

2. Frequently when I go back into older workouts that have been completed it clears the logged/completed data and erases anything done

3. There are times where it doesn’t load the workouts upcoming and the only way to get them to load is to go back into previous ones and then go forward again but that also erases my logged data as well

Please help. I love keeping track of things and logging data but sometimes my gym doesn’t put weight tracking for certain movements so I would like to add that exercise in so I can track my progress of weight

Hi there!

I have been a member with Paragon Training Methods for a while now (4-5 years if I remember correctly!). I have loved the workout programs that you design, and I am fully invested in your training program. 
This year, I have moved cities and gone to school for paramedic training. This has put a significant strain on me financially, and I am afraid I cannot afford my Paragon membership right now. I am hoping to pause my membership for 1 year, and return to it once I have a better situation financially. 
I stuck with Paragon through covid, and am a dedicated member. I supported Paragon through tough times, and I am hoping that Paragon will extend the same courtesy back to me. 

I look forward to hearing from you,

This month, we're getting into the nitty gritty of a few important drills and exercises. First up, we have a skill now regularly taught in CrossFit classes: the muscle up. It can feel pretty advanced, but we have a guide to help you get started. Next, we have plyometric drills. These are super important to help prevent injury and also improve performance. Finally, we'll cover bench pressing, and whether to arch or not to arch. Jump in!

Hi Kristen, 

I was just charged for an annual membership through Train Heroic and had intended on canceling my membership as per the email I sent. I am not in a position to keep this account or interested in a monthly membership. Please refund the account.

Hey Isabel, 

Thanks so much for reaching out and for being a loyal member to Paragon.

What if we switched your membership back to a monthly membership?
I'd be happy to apply a 40% discount to your account so that your membership is only $30/month going forward.
It'd be our way of saying thanks, and then you could still keep smashing your workouts and have coaching and community support from us (:

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!

 This month, we're getting into the nitty gritty of a few important drills and exercises. First up, we have a skill now regularly taught in CrossFit classes: the muscle up. It can feel pretty advanced, but we have a guide to help you get started. Next, we have plyometric drills. These are super important to help prevent injury and also improve performance. Finally, we'll cover bench pressing, and whether to arch or not to arch. Jump in!

"Hi,

Recently I have the same annoying bug repeatedly showing on two of my accounts and for several different athletes. It seems sporadic and I can't seem to identify what causes it.

Sessions will show as incomplete. Certain exercises will show as not having been logged/completed by athletes. When I confront them about it and remind them to log the exercises in question, they say that it is showing as logged/complete in their app. In my view, on my Macbook/desktop, it is showing as not completed.

I have now experienced this with a session on my own coach account. I had a session I completed today and one exercise is showing as blank on the desktop view. However, on my mobile/app view it is showing as not completed. See attached screenshots.

Few technical questions with dream team launch,"Darren,

My program is live under the team and as a program.
Some of the videos populate with a thumbnail in the app, other ones are a blank white thumbnail. They’re uploaded to YouTube the exact same way. Can you please advise?

Next, if you pull up the main link I’m using through the attributions for Instagram. The main picture is black even though it has been updated on my back in settings for the Team under the cover image. 

Lastly, On that same place how do I change the picture image for myself and Coach Tony Young?

Re: Team Forever Strong - New Program Landing Page,"Nathan,

We have a program in our library - WS4SB 3.5 - can you make it a standalone program with it's own sales page for $97.

Joe and Smitty, I'd like to make an intro to my colleague, Nathan Yamnitz.

Nathan is a long-time TrainHeroic customer and coach whom we hired to personally take care of our Power Sellers.

I've updated Nathan on our conversations, your goals, and briefed him on how he can support you two.

Going forward, Nathan will be your go-to for all things TrainHeroic and although he and his team will be proactive in their communication, just know that you can reach out to them for a spot anytime you need it.

I'm really excited for the two of you to get the chance to work together and I'm excited to watch you guys continue to grow the business.

I know Nathan will reach out, and in case it helps, here's a link to schedule time with him:

Thanks, you two!

Password reset and not receiving training program,Hello I tried purchasing a program just now and I’m not able to access it but it did get charged to my credit card.

Is it possible for me to merge two accounts if I have deleted one of them? The only part I care about is being able to use the previous email address, not any of the actual data from it.

Sam, 

 

Do you ever feel like programming takes up all of your time? Here’s a secret: creating training programs can be a breeze with TrainHeroic.

 

We’ve designed a coaching tool that will save you valuable time – so you can spend more time coaching, and less time programming.

 

Check out the Coach Playbook and see just how easy it is to create your first program.

Printing Issues,"I want to print out each athlete's training plan and use it during training because my gym does not allow athletes to bring their phones, and the training plans are customized according to each individual's characteristics. I tried to find team plan printing online, but it showed 'Failed to retrieve session 92050426 for user 1980412.'"
Billing Question,"Morning, I was wondering if I am still being billed for the Yoke Squad? My bank has been declining a charge for $32.46 for about a week now. I am registered for the Yoke Buds program that is due the 17th of every month. A response is greatly appreciated, Please and thank you.

TrainHeroic - Membership Update,"May I switch from yoke squad to yoke buds? My apologies for going back-and-forth. While I like the layout of yoke squad, better, it unfortunately calls for too many exercises that I don’t have access equipment wise.

Refund or switching programs?,"Hey, I have recently bought Terminator Bro Split Plus. I have realized that I am never going to actually use the program and it was a dumb decision too buy it from me. I know I am technically too late to refund but I thought it would be worth it to ask but if not. Could I switch it with 
BEGINNER MOBILITY PROGRAM by Vernon Griffith? 

Please and thank you."
