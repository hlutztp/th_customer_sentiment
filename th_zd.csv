<p dir=""auto"">I apologize for so many emails. I am trying to set up Zapier that you told me about. </p>

<p dir=""auto"">I wanted to give it a full try and see what it would look like on both ends when someone canceled. I subscribed to my program on TrainHeroic and when I went to delete/cancel the subscription from my phone, it flags it and says ""if you own the team, please use Coach on the web."" I tried to use the Coach on the web but it still will not let me remove myself from the subscription. I was hoping you could help walk me through it.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Also when someone purchases one of my training subscriptions are they added and counted as one of my active athletes on my coaching plan? I have 22 athletes but only 7 1:1 training athletes the rest are subscription.

Question about Athlete Pro Subscription,"Dear Trainheroic Customer Support Team,

I currently have an active Trainheroic Athlete Pro Subscription on my iphone. I am also subscribed to a training program, namely to a training program called ""Operation: Human Weapon"" for which I am roughly paying 15 USD per month.

My question is the following: If I cancel the Athlete Pro Subscription and remain subscribed to the monthly training program what would that change? Would I still have full access to the training program? And what is the advantage then of paying the Athlete Pro subscription?

I would really appreciate a clarification on this one.

Thank you so much in advance.

Best,

Sebastian"

When I generate supersets or circuits with multiple exercises - all the tutorial videos become the same.

So let's say there are three exercise in a circuit.

A1
A2
A3

A2 and A3 will have the same tutorial video as A1, even though A2 and A3 have their own independent tutorial video normally.

Please can you help me with this as it's becoming quite a problem with my clients.

I’d forgotten to cancel this. I was using it to create workouts for my dad, but he stopped training due to illness. As you’ll be able to see, I haven’t used it in a while. I’d really appreciate it if you could refund me for three months worth of dues.

Thanks very much,

Lift Heavy, Swing Fast New Cycle Workout 1 - Live on September 30th

This workout consists of supersets. Complete each exercise in the order listed before starting over again from the first.

For example, perform A1 and A2 once in order, then return to A1 and repeat for the prescribed sets.

All movements have video demonstrations with audio instructions linked to our YouTube channel. (https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u0xe4704tvh8l0gwrc6h6g0e5ggul/owhkhqhrm685lluv/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vQENvZHlXZXNjb3R0R29sZg==) ​

Before starting, warm up with 3-5 minutes of light cardio - such as jogging, walking or any machine at a low to moderate pace.

Once you finish this workout, you’ll have a great feel for what this program is all about.

Nothing showing,"Good morning 

Set the free trial up last Sunday and have done six days of training on the GBRS program. Now on the seventh day of the free trial my calendar shows no training plan for this last day of the trial. No explanation of this is a rest day etc. I have been billed for an upcoming month and yet I see no training plans for this upcoming week? I tried refreshing and also logging out and back in. What is the next step? My only training time is early morning and so now I am doing my own workout today because nothing is scheduled.

This was fixed and I think they said it was a glitch. This has happened again to the second returning member. It seems to be every time I unarchive and readd them to the team (or a coincidence?). Am i doing this wrong, is there a better way to unarchive and readd them? Obviously i want to archive them because they may come back but i don't want to be paying keeping them active.

Mobile Feedback,"Feedback: Hello!

There could be a glitch in the app. One of my athletes keyed in the number on the exercise and ticked it to indicate complete.

Then, the data went missing. They have to log in again to key in the number. It’s troublesome and not efficient for my athlete.

We need your help checking the app functionality.

TrainHeroic Marketplace is Now Enabled,"Hi Alyssa,

Your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!

**By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:**


1. **Use your own custom programming.** Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
2. **Keep your programming up to date.** You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
3. **Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions.** If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
4. **Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.**

**Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (****full explanation here****):**


- Any Team or Program sales that _we_ direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
- Team subscription sales generated through _your_ attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.

  - _*Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE_
- Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
- **For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for** _**your**_ **self-driven sales, check out this article:** **Marketplace Matching and Attributions**
- You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.

**Next steps: **
When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our **Guide to Building Your Sales page**.

*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.

<p dir=""auto"">Hi André,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thanks for reaching out and I'm sorry for the trouble!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">We do see this problem with our international users and it is frustrating.  The invalid message makes it appear our billing system is not accepting your credit card, but with time and working with other users it has been determined that banks are blocking the addition of credit cards because they suspect fraud.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">When you attempt to add your card, there is an initial validation of the card in the billing system with your bank.  This is when the bank blocks the addition of the card.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I recommend speaking with your bank and ask them to lift any holds/blocks they have for TrainHeroic.  Once the block is lifted, you will be able to add your credit card to your account.  There could be tighter controls for international transactions.  If this doesn't work, you can try to use a different credit card.</p>

Hello,

We wanted to let you know that the developer of the Android app 
*TrainHeroic: Workout Tracker* has replied to the Google Play review 
that you wrote for it on 28 Sept 2024.

*TrainHeroic: Workout Tracker*
Your rating:★★★★★

  Well designed and easy enough to navigate but an extremely frustrating user experience. Inputs are incredibly unresponsive. You have to type the same digits multiple times before the app even recognises the input. (This is on a Galaxy S23 FE, which is no slouch, but it happens on other devices too. It makes me want to uninstall it and tell my trainer to switch to a different app. AVOID this app until they fix these performance issues on Android!

*Developer response:*

Thank you for the review and we appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention. Please reach out tosupport@trainheroic.com, so we can look into this further. Thanks!

Mobile Feedback,"Feedback: There was a quote from Slyvia Plath that showed up on my rest day screen for today.

Personally I found the quote to be extremely offensive. Since the author of that quote committed suicide, and had other disturbing topics that she would regularly write about I suggest that it would be in the best interest of Train Heroic as an app and as a brand to not include motivational quotes from Slyvia Plath going forward. I am worried that these quotes might detrimentally affect the well being of people who read them, particularly communities who are affected by suicide.

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Dear Train Heroic Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently started my Train Heroic Free Trial for 2 programs by Paul Carter, believing that I had sufficient funds to cover the cost after the free week ends. However, during the free trial week, my financial situation worsened unexpectedly, and I now find myself unable to afford the membership due to unforeseen expenses.

I have since deleted the 2 training programs from my membership account, and as it has only been a day since the renewal, I am kindly requesting a refund. 

I greatly appreciate your understanding of my circumstances and hope that you can please assist me with this. It would be super helpful to have access to those funds in my current situation, and I am hopeful that you can help me out. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Please let me know if you need any further details to process the refund. 

Sincerely, 
Sehej Bhasin"

Meeting Request,"I am currently using Turnkey Coach for my personal training software and teambuildr for my team training software and google sheets/slides to create custom programs.

I would like to merge the three and use Trainheroic but would like to have a few questions answered.

1) Can I give ""video feedback"" for my 1:1 clients? If so, how would I deliver that to them? Or would I need to use Loom and message them the link?
2) Can I give session breakdown videos within the app? Similar to how a group fitness instructor would lead the beginning of a class, I would like to give a 2-5min talk on how to attack each session for my team training clients. If I am able to do this, do I deliver this within the team message board or would I need to email them separately?
3) Do you all assist in merging clients from other software (I only have 5 in Turnkey)

Would it be possible to have these answered via video call?

Thanks for your time and consideration!!

I think I forgot to click apply my promo code when I paid for my recent John Collin’s ski prep course. Would it still be possible to get the savings from promo code ?

Need help cancelling,"Hello,

I joined Train Heroic in April 2024, to workout on Nick Sullivan’s workout plan. However, I had never received an activation code and had struggled with activating through the app. 
So pretty much I’ve been just paying the monthly subscription since May 2024. 

I’m not asking for any money back; I simply want to cancel any existing subscription, and cancel my membership. 
I see that Train Heroic continues to try billing my credit card, and I would like to no longer have my card billed as I would like to cancel my subscription. 

Please let me know how we can make this possible. 

Thank you. 

Respectfully,
Carlos Gracia"
Lift History Not Showing Up,"History for certain lifts is not showing up AT ALL or it is not showing the most current history. The main example is for the bench press (""Bench Press - PHAROS"" in our library of movements). Within our Team “BUILD by Pharos” we almost always bench press on Tuesdays. We maxed out our bench press on September 3rd, 2024 and for the past three weeks have been using percentages of that max for our training. I have had a number of members show me in the app when we are doing the bench press again(exact same movement from our movements library), the listed “WORKING MAX” is either very old or not showing up at all. I even had them go back to September 3rd to show me that they input a 1RM on that day and they all did. I tried to verify this myself on my own app, so I put in my numbers for September 3rd - it shows that I am hitting a 1RM or 2RM, etc with a little trophy next to the input and even updates my working max for that day to what I had just input “245”. I even made sure to go all the way through the “day” and click on “done training” at the very end. I then went to the workout for September 10th, September, 17th, and September 24th (all days with bench press) and when I click on that portion of the workout it reports my history or LAST as “None” and there is no WORKING MAX available. I have attached pictures of what I am seeing. Please let me know what is happening and how to fix this as being able to refer easily to past Maxes, etc. is very important to members."

Hi there!

I have been a member with Paragon Training Methods for a while now (4-5 years if I remember correctly!). I have loved the workout programs that you design, and I am fully invested in your training program. 
This year, I have moved cities and gone to school for paramedic training. This has put a significant strain on me financially, and I am afraid I cannot afford my Paragon membership right now. I am hoping to pause my membership for 1 year, and return to it once I have a better situation financially. 
I stuck with Paragon through covid, and am a dedicated member. I supported Paragon through tough times, and I am hoping that Paragon will extend the same courtesy back to me. 

I look forward to hearing from you,

Sincerely,

Katie Milligen"

My Athlete signed up for an account and joined Benefit Strength Training two days ago. However, when she signed up she inputted the wrong email information and she was not able to access anything.

She deleted her account, but when she went to create a new account it said she already had an account even though she had deleted it. When she tried to access it by creating a new password, she was unable to since the email address does not exist.

Can you please assist her with this?

Her information is:

The email that is on file (the incorrect email) is carolinaastract1994@centurylink.net

She would like the email address and password to be:

And if you are able to subscribe her to Benefit Strength Training, that would be great, if not I will have her do that with the new account!

This month, we're getting into the nitty gritty of a few important drills and exercises. First up, we have a skill now regularly taught in CrossFit classes: the muscle up. It can feel pretty advanced, but we have a guide to help you get started. Next, we have plyometric drills. These are super important to help prevent injury and also improve performance. Finally, we'll cover bench pressing, and whether to arch or not to arch. Jump in!

Thanks so much for reaching out and for being a loyal member to Paragon.

What if we switched your membership back to a monthly membership?
I'd be happy to apply a 40% discount to your account so that your membership is only $30/month going forward.
It'd be our way of saying thanks, and then you could still keep smashing your workouts and have coaching and community support from us (:

 This month, we're getting into the nitty gritty of a few important drills and exercises. First up, we have a skill now regularly taught in CrossFit classes: the muscle up. It can feel pretty advanced, but we have a guide to help you get started. Next, we have plyometric drills. These are super important to help prevent injury and also improve performance. Finally, we'll cover bench pressing, and whether to arch or not to arch. Jump in!

One of the most advanced gymnastics skills is now regularly taught in CrossFit classes: the muscle up. You can do them on a pull up bar or gymnastics rings; you can do them strict or with a heaving full-body kip. That is, if you can do them at all.

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastian,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thanks for the information. I found your SC Training Club under this email, <a href=""mailto:sebtrainss@gmail.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">sebtrainss@gmail.com</a>. So, your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:</p>

<p dir=""auto"">1. Use your own custom programming. Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
<br>2. Keep your programming up to date. You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
<br>3. Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions. If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
<br>4. Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (full explanation here (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156808889997-Marketplace-Seller-Terms-Payment-Information"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156808889997-Marketplace-Seller-Terms-Payment-Information</a>) ):</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Any Team or Program sales that we direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
<br>* Team subscription sales generated through your attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">** *Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
<br>* For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for your self-driven sales, check out this article: Marketplace Matching and Attributions (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156549307277-For-Coaches-Marketplace-Matching-Attributions-and-Affiliate-Links"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156549307277-For-Coaches-Marketplace-Matching-Attributions-and-Affiliate-Links</a>)
<br>* You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.</p>

<br>When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our Guide to Building Your Sales page (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18170983824013-Setting-Up-Your-Marketplace-Page"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18170983824013-Setting-Up-Your-Marketplace-Page</a>) .</p>

<p dir=""auto"">*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastián,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Happy to help! It sounds like you want to start your own head coach account and sell in the Marketplace.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I want you to be aware that your athletes will not follow you when I cancel your assistant coach license. All content you created belongs to Martin's organization, D.Tale Academy, so all programming you have created for your athletes will need to be recreated manually. We do not have a way to transfer it to your new account.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">If this sounds good to you, I will cancel your assistant coach license, create a new coach account using your existing account, then enable your Marketplace settings.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Please confirm you would like to proceed with this plan.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastián, thanks for getting in touch!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">We require that all Marketplace coaches have a paid Coach account. I see you are an assistant coach for Martin Itersky, so all Marketplace settings are controlled in his account.

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastián, thanks for getting in touch!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">We require that all Marketplace coaches have a paid Coach account. I see you are an assistant coach for Martin Itersky, so all Marketplace settings are controlled in his account. As an assistant, you do not have access to the settings in your account. If Martin wants his Marketplace settings enabled, let me know and I will turn them on.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">The TrainHeroic Marketplace offers an opportunity for coaches to grow their online sales, with integrated billing, business analytics, and a Zapier integration to support your email service provider.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Our Marketplace is best suited for group training, and not necessarily for billing personal training clients. We also recommend that you have an existing client base and marketing plan to kick-start your online business.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">As you're weighing your options, we encourage you to read through the links below, which will provide more information about Marketplace terms and conditions, payments and payouts, as well as the difference between a Coach Plan and Marketplace:</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastian,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thanks for the information. I found your SC Training Club under this email, <a href=""mailto:sebtrainss@gmail.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">sebtrainss@gmail.com</a>. So, your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:</p>

<p dir=""auto"">1. Use your own custom programming. Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
<br>2. Keep your programming up to date. You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
<br>3. Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions. If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
<br>4. Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (full explanation here (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156808889997-Marketplace-Seller-Terms-Payment-Information"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156808889997-Marketplace-Seller-Terms-Payment-Information</a>) ):</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Any Team or Program sales that we direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
<br>* Team subscription sales generated through your attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">** *Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
<br>* For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for your self-driven sales, check out this article: Marketplace Matching and Attributions (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156549307277-For-Coaches-Marketplace-Matching-Attributions-and-Affiliate-Links"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156549307277-For-Coaches-Marketplace-Matching-Attributions-and-Affiliate-Links</a>)
<br>* You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Next steps:
<br>When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our Guide to Building Your Sales page (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18170983824013-Setting-Up-Your-Marketplace-Page"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18170983824013-Setting-Up-Your-Marketplace-Page</a>) .</p>

<p dir=""auto"">*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastián,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Happy to help! It sounds like you want to start your own head coach account and sell in the Marketplace.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I want you to be aware that your athletes will not follow you when I cancel your assistant coach license. All content you created belongs to Martin's organization, D.Tale Academy, so all programming you have created for your athletes will need to be recreated manually. We do not have a way to transfer it to your new account.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">If this sounds good to you, I will cancel your assistant coach license, create a new coach account using your existing account, then enable your Marketplace settings.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Please confirm you would like to proceed with this plan.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastián, thanks for getting in touch!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">We require that all Marketplace coaches have a paid Coach account. I see you are an assistant coach for Martin Itersky, so all Marketplace settings are controlled in his account. As an assistant, you do not have access to the settings in your account. If Martin wants his Marketplace settings enabled, let me know and I will turn them on.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">The TrainHeroic Marketplace offers an opportunity for coaches to grow their online sales, with integrated billing, business analytics, and a Zapier integration to support your email service provider.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Our Marketplace is best suited for group training, and not necessarily for billing personal training clients. We also recommend that you have an existing client base and marketing plan to kick-start your online business.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">As you're weighing your options, we encourage you to read through the links below, which will provide more information about Marketplace terms and conditions, payments and payouts, as well as the difference between a Coach Plan and Marketplace:</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastian,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Thanks for the information. I found your SC Training Club under this email, <a href=""mailto:sebtrainss@gmail.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">sebtrainss@gmail.com</a>. So, your Marketplace settings are now enabled and you can begin selling Teams and Programs right away!</p>

<p dir=""auto"">By selling in the TrainHeroic Marketplace, you're agreeing to:</p>

<p dir=""auto"">1. Use your own custom programming. Using TrainHeroic pre-built programming or another coaches programming may result in a loss of sales and removal from the Marketplace.
<br>2. Keep your programming up to date. You're required to publish programming for the current day (as well as all past programming), though we recommend allowing your athletes to view up to a week in advance as best practice. Un-publishing programming from past weeks will result in removal from the Marketplace.
<br>3. Create programming that reflects your advertisements and descriptions. If you advertise 3 sessions per week, you're required to publish 3 sessions per week.
<br>4. Be responsive to athletes questions via TH Chat.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Here's a quick overview of how Marketplace fees and payouts work (full explanation here (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156808889997-Marketplace-Seller-Terms-Payment-Information"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156808889997-Marketplace-Seller-Terms-Payment-Information</a>) ):</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Any Team or Program sales that we direct through Marketplace Match will have a 30% fee based on the purchase price + bank fees of 2.9% and $0.30.
<br>* Team subscription sales generated through your attribution links will be $1/transaction plus 2.9% + $0.30 in bank fees.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">** *Note, YOU MUST USE YOUR ATTRIBUTION LINKS IN ORDER TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR THE SALE</p>

<p dir=""auto"">* Any one-time program sales are $1/month in length + bank fees. For example, a 4-week program is $1 + bank fees and an 8-week program would be $2 + fees
<br>* For more information on Marketplace Match and using your attribution links to receive credit for your self-driven sales, check out this article: Marketplace Matching and Attributions (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156549307277-For-Coaches-Marketplace-Matching-Attributions-and-Affiliate-Links"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18156549307277-For-Coaches-Marketplace-Matching-Attributions-and-Affiliate-Links</a>)
<br>* You'll be paid on the 15th of each month, for the prior month's sales via PayPal.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Next steps:
<br>When you're ready for the next steps, the blue link here will bring you to our Guide to Building Your Sales page (<a href=""https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18170983824013-Setting-Up-Your-Marketplace-Page"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://support.trainheroic.com/hc/en-us/articles/18170983824013-Setting-Up-Your-Marketplace-Page</a>) .</p>

<p dir=""auto"">*Please be aware that your team will be available for sale as soon as you set the team or program marketplace setting to ""Yes."" We recommend hiding the team from the marketplace while your programming and sales page are being setup.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Hi Sebastián,</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Happy to help! It sounds like you want to start your own head coach account and sell in the Marketplace.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">I want you to be aware that your athletes will not follow you when I cancel your assistant coach license. All content you created belongs to Martin's organization, D.Tale Academy, so all programming you have created for your athletes will need to be recreated manually. We do not have a way to transfer it to your new account.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">If this sounds good to you, I will cancel your assistant coach license, create a new coach account using your existing account, then enable your Marketplace settings.</p>

<p dir=""auto"">Please confirm you would like to proceed with this plan.</p>

Hello! Yesterday we had our subscription cancelled...,"Hello! Yesterday we had our subscription cancelled. I believe it was a billing issue but I am also aware that D1 corporate is no longer working with y'all so I wanted to see if some things have changed. 

I updated our billing but when I did all of our assistant coaches were kicked off. In the past, we were allowed 5 free assistant coaches, is this still true or is this no longer an option? I have a few coaches that need access to their workouts for their personal training clients so trying to figure that out.

Also, I noticed that our log in e-mail address for our main account is a very old e-mail that we no longer use. Right now it is d1cosprings@gmail.com and our current email is d1coloradosprings@gmail.com, is there a way to change this?

If I add an athlete to my team do they get access to it without having to put in payment details? We already have around 15 clients on our subscription via stripe payments, so would ideally keep them on this and just add them without having to take payment details again.

Then any new clients if we just link them to the marketplace via one of our attribution links then they add payment details and that's all done through paypal via trainheroic with fees etc. Is this  correct?

I ve seen that your app can handle up to 1000 athletes.
Is it possible to go higher on those numbers?
Also do to potentially high numbers of members, is it possible to have the workouts available in specific programs for the members to go get it or does it have to be set on their calendar(which would be a real issue due to the high volume of members)?

TrainHeroic Billing Update,"Hello,

I recently signed up for the Summers Method Performance team cited in the subject line. I was previously on this team but cancelled because they stopped delivering programs. I just signed up for it again yesterday thinking they may be creating programs again. However, there are no sessions created at all. 

Please cancel this team from my recurring payments and refund the $37 I just paid for this month. I would also look into this and remove this team if they are not delivering programs. I’m sure there are others who have paid for this and received nothing in return. 

Please confirm receipt and refund.

I'm looking to advertise my team on the marketplace (on a recurring membership) but I'm concerned that some of those I'm marketing to will not want to pay in USD. What do you suggest for these people? is there a way to charge in GPB? Or if not, can I sell separately and pay train heroic via my athlete list? in that case what would you suggest for keeping track of whether peoples memberships remain active etc?

I hope that makes sense.

Many thanks :)

Zapier Question,"Hey,

I'm having some issues with my zapier/trainheroic set up and just wanted to ask a quick question.

The zapier trigger says

* Marketplace - New Program Sale

Does that include team sales too?  I assume it does, but just want to double check, because everywhere else it's pretty deliberate about specifying the difference between programs and teams.

Thanks.

Plus, training with naked feet and blasting those abs.

Alright, Heroes, this month we're talking shoulders, feet and abs. We've got six ways to keep those oft-injured shoulders healthy. Have you been working out with naked feet? Might be something to dip your toes into. Plus, don't sleep on those obliques for power-packed abs. Let's get after it!

Shoulder injuries are the most commonly injured area for athletes. Check out these six exercises to help prevent injuries around life and training.

Foot mechanics are an increasingly hot topic in modern athletics. More athletes are discovering the pitfalls of shoes and the benefits of being able to use their feet properly. Maybe barefoot training has been on your radar, but where do you start?

Not seeing any progress with your current ab routine? Bored of the same old core exercises you’ve been doing since high school? Ditch the endless crunches, sit-ups and front planks, and do these three movements instead for ultimate strength.

4. If you start the free trial to get a feel for the software, is there automatic billing at the end of 7 days? (Hopefully not!)

5. Is there any training guides linked to the software for first-time users? i.e. guides on how to put programs together easily for beginners?

6. Does the software include varied training modalities (1rm weight percentages per set, Intervals/Tabatas, EMOM, AMRAP, etc)?

As mentioned in my previous email, **your current TrainHeroic contract ends on 10/4/24. Do you plan on renewing?**

**If you will need a quote to get approval for the upcoming renewal, please let me know and I will get one sent over to you ASAP.** Previously you received two years of access for unlimited athletes and 13 coach logins for $6,477.12 and we're happy to offer that again if you'd like to lock that price.

If the account payment is not received, account access will automatically be removed 7 days after your renewal date on 10/4/24.  Please keep us in the loop as to your plans so we can avoid that.

If you have any questions on your account billing or about using the platform, just say the word!

Standing by,"

is there a way to have people who subscribe to a team to choose/jump between 2 different programs (3x/week and 4x/week) ? Or do I need to create 2 separate teams? That would be very unfortunate and impractical, so I hope there is a way to do this inside 1 team, so they can still filter programs and view only the one they care about in the app?

Thanks for your response! :)

TrainHeroic- Billing Update,I want to cancel this subscription
Billing for athletes,"Hello, 

I’m just reaching out with a quick question about one of my athletes billing.

He messaged me an said he got a message that his credit card was declined/needed to be updated.

He is in Germany and I think uses a German credit card. I’ve attached the email he got as a photo to this email, he’s nervous that it is a potential scam.

Everything looks legit from my perspective but I have never heard of the peaksware software as obviously the billing is handled from your companies end. 

I just wanted to check for him to make sure that this switch is legit and isn’t some sort of scam he may have fallen into.

The athletes name is Samuel Payeur and he is on the Elite Edge training subscription.

Thank you in advance for your help

Cheers,
Morgan"
Dumbbell (lbs) Input ,"For dumbbell exercises, should I be entering the weight of the individual dumbbells or the total weight for each dumbbell? For example, a dumbbell bench-press using two 50lbs dumbbells, should I enter the weight as 50lbs or 100lbs? Thanks!"
